This is the 'whatlang' language identifier, updated to use FramepaC-ng
and compile properly in C++11 under more recent compilers than the
version originally included as part of LA-Strings (the language-aware
text-string extractor).

The makefile assumes that the 'framepac' subdirectory contains a copy
of FramepaC-ng.  If you already have a copy installed, just make it a
symlink (git has been told to ignore 'framepac').  Otherwise, you can
use 'git submodule' to install a copy from the FramepaC-ng repo.

Due to the size of the data files for training, they have not been
copied to GitHub.  You can still retrieve them from SourceForge, at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/la-strings/files/Language-Data/
